- Neural Editor is a tool that makes researching ML/DL a lot easier just by drag & drop Nodes which is equivalent to a Layer in Pytorch (future version will 
  support others ML libraries).
- Because of some technical issue with compiling Python files & folders into an .exe file, user need to open up Pycharm (or any other IDE) and locate then
  run "screen/screen.py" files.
- Graph of "Train / Loss" is not currently available because of Kivy (a third-party library for UI development) newer version.
