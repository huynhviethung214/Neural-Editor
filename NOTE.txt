1. MERGE TRAINING AND EVALUATING FOLDER TOGETHER 'CAUSE EVALUATING PROCESS WILL
ALWAYS BE EXECUTED AFTER TRAINING PROCESS ✅
2. FINISHING TENSOR / KERNEL EDITOR ✅
3. SPLIT PROCESSORS INTO MANY FILES IN 'PROCESSOR' FOLDER THEN FIX THE
ALGORITHM IN 'processor.py' (DONE) ✅
4. ADD DEVICE SELECTION IN SETTING SECTION (LATER VERSION) ✅
5. DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL OR CREATE CUSTOM ICONS (USING PHOTOSHOP MAYBE..)
6. CREATE FOLDER TO SAVE TRAINED MODEL WEIGHT ✅
7. IMPROVE UI GRAPHIC
8. IMPROVE RIGHT-CLICKED TOOLBAR
9. DISPLAY BEZIERS WHEN LOADING MODEL ✅
10. SPLIT TRAINING AND EVALUATING ALGORITHMS INTO MANY FILES IN 'nn_algorithms' FOLDER & FIX
THE ALGORITHM IN 'generate_evaluating_algorithms.py' AND 'generate_training_algorithms.py' ✅
11. ADD MORE HELPER FUNCTION LIKE CONCAT, .... ✅
12. SAVE CRITERION & OPTIMIZER & PROCESSOR & TRAINING/EVALUATING FUNCTIONS INTO SAVED MODEL ✅
13. SAVE CHECKPOINT WHEN TERMINATING THE TRAINING PROCESS ✅
14. FIX `TERMINATE` BUTTON ✅
15. MOVE TRAINING / EVALUATING SETUP TO A NEW FILE IN A NEW DIRECTORY ✅
16. FIX GRAPHICAL DISPLAY IN 'interface' (BEZIERS POSITION AND NODES POSITION THAT
    AREN'T RELATED TO IT PARENT - ScatterPlaneLayout) ✅
17. DYNAMIC TRAINING / EVALUATING ALGORITHM
18. CAPTURING EXCEPTIONS
19. SAVED MODEL CAN BE USED TO FORM A STACKED NODE ✅
20. ADD DEFAULT VALUE IN EACH PRE-BUILT NODE ✅
21. ADD KERNEL INPUT TYPE SELECTION IN NODE EDITOR
22. MAKE COLLAPSABLE SECTION IN `node.py` ✅
23. REMOVE BEZIERS WHEN UNBINDING NODES ✅
24. SAVE & LOAD STACKED NODE PROPERLY ✅

30. Fix TAB'S NAME IN `TabManager`
31. FIX `Scripting Screen` ✅
32. Switch HVFS after changing tab in Interface's TabManager ✅
33. DE-GROUPING GROUPED NODES ✅
34. REMOVE ALL THE `algorithms` BECAUSE WE CAN GENERATE THEM USING A SINGLE PYTHON FUNCTION ✅
35. BINDING ALL 3RD PARTY PACKAGES FOR TRAINING NEURAL NETWORK USING GPU PROGRAMMING
36. ADD HIERARCHY TREE IN AS A SIDE-PANEL TO VIEW CURRENT NODES/GROUPS ✅
37. CURRENTLY CANNOT STACKING THE STACKED NODE
